                <ol>
                    <li>The game is played with 2-6 players.</li>
                    <li>Each player is dealt 7 cards (or 5 if there are more than 3 players).</li>
                    <li>The remaining cards are placed face down to form a draw pile.</li>
                    <li>Players take turns asking other players for cards to make sets of four.</li>
                    <li>If the asked player has the requested card, they must give it up.</li>
                    <li>If not, they say "Go fish," and the asker draws from the pile.</li>
                    <li>When a player collects a set of four, they place it face up in front of them.</li>
                    <li>The game ends when all sets have been collected.</li>
                    <li>The player with the most sets wins!</li>
